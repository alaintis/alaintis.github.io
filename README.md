# Alain Tissier's Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal website built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The site includes information about my background, projects and curriculum vitae.

## Live Site

The website is available at [https://alain-tissier.com](https://alain-tissier.com).

## Running Locally

To preview the site locally you need Ruby installed. Once Ruby is available you can install Jekyll and run the development server:

```bash
# Install Jekyll (and Bundler if you do not have it)
gem install jekyll bundler

# Start the server from the repository root
jekyll serve
```

This will start a local server at `http://localhost:4000` where you can view changes as you edit the files.
