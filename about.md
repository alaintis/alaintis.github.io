## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi! I'm **Alain Tissier**, a Computational Science and Engineering student at **ETH ZÃ¼rich**, specializing in **Computational Finance**.

I enjoy blending my technical skills with an entrepreneurial mindset. Whether itâ€™s working on simulations, diving into data, or optimizing financial models, I love tackling complex problems with a clear, data-driven approach.

But life isn't all numbers and code! I'm passionate about sports â€” especially **windsurfing**, which keeps me energized and focused. One of the most enriching chapters of my life was my time in **Australia**, where I not only improved my English but also embraced a new culture, nature, and perspective.

I'm always open to collaboration, new ideas, and exciting challenges. Letâ€™s connect and build something great.
