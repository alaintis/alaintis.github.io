## 👋 About Me

Hi! I'm **Alain**, a Computational Science and Engineering student at **ETH Zürich**, specializing in **Computational Finance**.

I enjoy blending my technical skills with an entrepreneurial mindset. Whether it’s working on simulations, diving into data, or optimizing financial models, I love tackling complex problems with a clear, data-driven approach.

But life isn't all numbers and code! I'm passionate about sports — especially **windsurfing**, which keeps me energized and focused. 

I'm always open to collaboration, new ideas, and exciting challenges. Let’s connect and build something great.
